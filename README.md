# Codey
Android Mobile Application prototype aimed to teach students how to code in Java.

This was an Honours Project idea which I fully designed and developed.

My plan was to go back to it after university and develop it into a complete application but my adobe photoshop subscription ran out which is how I
made all my graphical layouts for the app, therefore the project was haulted.

When I can get my subscription back up and running, I will continue development on the app.

The features that will be added are;
- more topics
- more exercises
- a UI for selecting specific topics to learn
- possbility of allowing usrs to code in their preferred language to solve exercises?
- going back and designing more efficient code
- trying to find ways to lower graphic memory sizes for layouts but keep high quality
